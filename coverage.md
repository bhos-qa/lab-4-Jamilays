### Statement Coverage
This coverage ensures that every executable statement in the code is executed at least once. It measures how many lines of code are exercised during testing.

### Branch Coverage
This coverage checks that every possible path (true/false) in control structures like `if`, `else`, `switch` is tested.

### Predicate Coverage
This coverage ensures that all Boolean expressions have been evaluated to both true and false during the testing phase.
